# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Themes

These have some small requirements before usage in your vault(s):
- Rename themes to `obsidian.css` when adding them to your vault
- Go to Settings > Plugins and enable the "Custom CSS" plugin. You have to do this per-vault, because the application (handily) gives each vault their own config.
- Switch your Appearance (in Settings > Appearance) to whatever appaearance is (in parentheses) in the theme heading below.

Each theme's heading links to its raw CSS; alternatively, browse and/or download the desired CSS in the `out` folder.

## [Initial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnMod/css-themes/master/obsidian/out/initial.css) (light)

This theme exemplifies some of the styling choices for my personal design system. Currently an early work-in-progress!

## [Sulfur Trioxide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnMod/css-themes/master/obsidian/out/so3.css) (dark)

A theme intending to emulate the user interface of [Star Ocean: Till the End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_Till_the_End_of_Time).

## [Sulfur Trioxide: Dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnMod/css-themes/master/obsidian/out/so3-dict.css) (dark)

A modification of Sulfur Trioxide to better align with [Star Ocean: Till the End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_Till_the_End_of_Time)'s dictionary feature, which Obsidian's workflow reminds me of.

This was made for [my implementation of that feature as an Obsidian vault](https://github.com/EnMod/obsidian-so3-dictionary).
