# [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Themes

These have some small requirements before usage in your vault(s):

- Theme destinations should be set to `/path/to/vault/.obsidian/snippets`, as of the latest versions of Obsidian.  Once added there, they can be activated via Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets.
- Switch your Appearance (in Settings > Appearance) to whatever appearance is (in parentheses) in the theme headings below.

Each theme's heading links to its raw CSS; alternatively, browse and/or download the desired CSS in the `out` folder.

These are currently stable in `0.7.3`. As Obsidian rapidly develops and approaches `1.0.0` they might break! Use with caution.

## [Initial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnMod/css-themes/master/obsidian/out/initial.css) (light)

This theme exemplifies some of the styling choices for my personal design system.

It's meant to be used with the [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) Obsidian theme as a base as well as its companion [Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) plugin.

## [Sulfur Trioxide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnMod/css-themes/master/obsidian/out/so3.css) (dark)

A theme intending to emulate the user interface of [Star Ocean: Till the End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_Till_the_End_of_Time).

## [Sulfur Trioxide: Dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnMod/css-themes/master/obsidian/out/so3-dict.css) (dark)

A modification of Sulfur Trioxide to better align with [Star Ocean: Till the End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Ocean:_Till_the_End_of_Time)'s dictionary feature, which Obsidian's workflow reminds me of.

This was made for [my implementation of that feature as an Obsidian vault](https://github.com/EnMod/obsidian-so3-dictionary).
